9781840189070,5,Soldier Five : The Real Truth About The Bravo Two Zero Mission,Turcotte Ltd,991,"SOLDIER FIVE is an elite soldier's explosive memoir of his time within the Special Air Service (SAS) and, in particular, his experiences during the 1991 Gulf War. As a member of the Special Forces patrol now famously known by its call sign Bravo Two Zero, he and seven others were inserted hundreds of kilometres behind enemy lines. Their mission to reconnoitre targets, undertake surveillance of Scud missil sites and sabotage Iraqi communications links was to end in desperate failure.From the outset, the patrol was dogged by problems that contributed both directly and indirectly to the demise of the mission. The patrol's compromise, and subsequent attempts to evade Iraqi troops, resulted in four members of Bravo Two Zero being captured and a further three killed. One escaped. But the story goes further that the Gulf War itself. Despite numerous books, films and articles on the same subject, the British Government has done its utmost to thwart the release of SOLDIER FIVE, at one stage claiming the book in its entirety was confidential. A campaign of harassment that took some four and a half years of litigation to resolve has now resulted in this controversial publication. SOLDIER FIVE is a gripping and suspenseful account of one man's experiences as a Special Forces soldier. Revealing his conflicts and loyalties, and the relationships he forged both on and off the battlefield, this book is the resolution of a soldier's determined fight to see his story told.",7,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/8401/9781840189070.jpg,en
9781844547371,3,Underbelly : The Gangland War,Hansen-Collins,302,"John Moran and Carl Williams were the two biggest rival drug barons in Australia. They certainly weren't partners, but they weren't sworn enemies. One day, they had a meeting to end a dispute over drug money. Thinking he could scare his rival into submission, Moran pulled the trigger on Carl but decided not to finish the job off. It turned out to be the biggest mistake of his life.  Carl was hell bent on revenge. Within months, most of the Moran family and a host of underworld figures would die in an astonishing spate of revenge killings which shook the public and the police to the core. Murder, greed, drugs, sex and corruption abound in a story that reads like a piece of gangster fiction. But in Underbelly, the bullets and the blood are grippingly real.  This is true crime of the highest order - the amazing story of a powerful man who did things his way and eventually orchestrated his own terrible downfall.",3,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/8445/9781844547371.jpg,en

From Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history. Throughout this book, Harris argues that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow, and that how we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the quality of our lives. Waking Up is part memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris--a scientist, philosopher, and famous skeptic--could write it.",6,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9781/4516/9781451636024.jpg,en

The rules of the game have changed forever - but does this 'death of distance', which requires us all to run faster in order to stay in the same place, mean the world has got too small and too flat too fast for us to adjust?

Ranging across the history of technology, cultural studies and literary criticism, the text shows what had erased, forgotten, and elided to conceive of information as a disembodied entity. The author moves from the post-World War II Macy Conferences on cybernetics to the 1952 novel ""Limbo"" by Bernard Wolfe; from the concept of self-making to Philip K. Dick's literary explorations of hallucination and reality; and from artificial life to postmodern novels exploring the implications of seeing humans as cybernetic systems.",4,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/2263/9780226321462.jpg,en

9780521592710,5,Probability Theory : The Logic of Science,DuBuque-Gleason,287,"The standard rules of probability can be interpreted as uniquely valid principles in logic. In this book, E. T. Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between 'probability theory' and 'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary.",12,https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/5215/9780521592710.jpg,en
